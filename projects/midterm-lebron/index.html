                <p>Despite being a team sport, some NBA teams rely on a star to get them to the finals more than others.
                    Did Giannis do it without help? <em>Not really.</em> Did MJ carry Pippen? <em>Sometimes.</em> Is
                    LeBron amazing? Yes.</p>
                <p>There are plenty of opinionated articles and videos debating this already. So I figured I would add
                    my data-driven take to the mix. What do the data say about ranking the biggest Finals carry jobs in
                    NBA history?</p>
                <p>The data say that LeBron’s (losing) effort with the 2018 Cavaliers reigns supreme.</p>
                <p class="green"><em>Advanced stat haters should stop reading.</em></p>
                <p>To answer this I used the all-in-one advanced stat RAPTOR WAR (WAR) created by 538, a good measure
                    for how many wins a player contributed vs. what a replacement level player would. But we can’t just
                    measure who had the highest WAR in isolation since both games and minutes played factor in. It needs
                    to be relative to the rest of the team.</p>
                <p>To rank the biggest carry jobs, I decided to look at the WAR share among the top three players on a
                    team. I could’ve picked any number of players to compare, but most great teams have at least two or
                    three stars, with the rest filling in as role players, so three is the magic number.</p>

                    <p>This chart shows a player's WAR in the playoffs vs. their minutes played for every team in the
                        NBA finals since 1997. Players with more uniform impact are clustered closer together, and those
                        with standout performances are higher and more separated.</p>
                    <p>The <a href="#" class="black">2005 pistons</a> represents the "no 'I' in team" philosophy.</p>
                    <p>The <a class="black" href="#">1008 Bulls</a> and the <a class="black" href="#">2020 Lakers</a>
                        are prime examples of a
                        dynamic duo.</p>
                    <p>And finally we have Duncan leading the <a class="black" href="#">2003 Spurs</a>, Wade with <a

                            Heat</a>, and LeBron basically every year, but notably with the <a class="black"
                            href="#">2018 Cavs</a>
                        representing the single-handed carry jobs.</p>
