            <p>The University of Maryland continues to struggle with mold in student housing, even after the 2018
                death of Olivia Paregol, partially attributed to mold. </p>
            <p>Sophia Derr, a freshman living in Centreville Hall, noticed that her and her roommate were constantly
                getting sick. </p>
            <p>Multiple others living on the same floor of Centreville Hall had raised concerns about mold, so Derr
                bought a mold test kit from Amazon.</p>
            <p>To her surprise, multiple different molds began to grow in her petri dish – including black mold.

            <p>Black mold can cause a range of harmful and dangerous symptoms. When encountering black mold spores,
                coughing, sneezing, and eye irritation are some of the most common symptoms.
            </p>
            <p>Black mold poisoning can get much more serious, with nausea, vomiting, and <em>bleeding in the lungs.
                </em></p>
            <p>Derr informed her resident advisor about the mold, who told her bosses and shared the photos and videos
                of the mold that Derr had documented.</p>
            <p>4WORK, the University of Maryland’s residential facilities’ service crew, came to Centreville Hall over
                Thanksgiving break, and said that there were no signs of mold found in the room, though 4WORK claimed
                they did clean the filters in the room.</p>
            <p>The UMD policy for addressing mold is to send a qualified worker to rooms, and they will clean areas of
                the room that they find mold growth in. </p>
            <p> A resident of another room in Centreville Hall called 4WORK and claimed that they had similar problems
                to Derr.</p>
            <p>The resident mentioned the mold test that Derr had performed, but 4WORK said that they could not use the
                test seriously as there was no proof that the test was performed “truthfully.”</p>
            <p>“It felt horrible,” Derr said. “I was upset that they wouldn’t take my concerns seriously since I have
                been dealing with these problems for weeks.” </p>
            <p>Derr says that she bought an air purifier to try and clear the air, and she will be using another mold
                test kit soon. She currently still feels sick and attributes her symptoms partially to mild mold
                poisoning. Her symptoms included a persistent cough that she is struggling to handle.</p>

                    class="firstlinks">frequently asked questions about mold.</a></p>
            <p>According to a review conducted by the University of Maryland Board of Regents, it was found that the
                University System of Maryland followed protocol in informing students about the prescence of mold.</p>
            <p>There has been little information published by the University of Maryland besides the report saying that
                protocol was followed and their <a href="https://umd.edu/mold-response-fall-2018" target="_blank"

                Derr's problems were not the first time a student this year has expressed concerns about mold.</p>

            <p> Many students have raised concerns again and again and feel dejected by the university when they receive
                responses like the one Derr got.

            <P>To gather data about students and mold this semester, I surveyed students on different UMD forums,
                including the University of Maryland Discord, subreddit, and various chats. </P>

            <p class="graphs">Out of students that responded and found mold, there's a tendency to not report finding
                mold. One student who responded said that they did not bother reporting because the university already
                knows that there is a considerable mold problem in their dorm (Somerset Hall).</p>

            <p>While some students who report the findings of mold, like Derr, don't get the response that they want,
                some students just won't report at all.
             </p>
             <p> It's a concerning statistic, and University of Maryland students need to be vigilant for their own health and respond adequately if they don't want to inform the school.</p>
