    <p><em>Nocturne</em>, a four ton steel sculpture, currently sits next to the Art-Sociology building at the University of Maryland. Before being shown at UMD, the work was a part of the Artscape Sculpture Exhibiton in Baltimore.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Dunnill travelled in India in 2001 to gain experience with steel in ship breaking yards. Eventually, amongst other works, this experience led to the creation of <em>Nocturne</em>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The work is an example of how Dunnill's work is inspired by the industrial side of America. There are a number of different possible interpretations for <em>Nocturne</em>. The steel Dunnill uses tells a story in itself in the way that it was intricately bent.</p> 
    <br>
    <p>Throughout his work, the meaning of his pieces stayed largely on how "materials spoke to him". Trevor Richardson and Scott Habes wrote in <em>Andrew Dunnill: Extractions</em> that the piece has been interpreted as a representation of the body and revealing emotion over the aesthetics of such a piece.</p>

      <div class="col"> <p>The late Andrew Dunnill, a British-born sculptor, dazzled and reached many with his massive-scale steel works. </p>
        <br> 
        <p>Dunnill earned his Bacheleor's degree at West Surrey College in the United Kingdom, but acquired his MFA overseas at the University of Maryland.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Dunnill taught at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, earning the respect of his colleagues and students alike. His works produced in his studio found their way to national and international exhibitions, drawing the attention of many.</p>
        <br>
        <P>He described his own work, saying, "I imply movement, turning, rolling, crawling. The sculptures, however, remains firmly rooted to the ground." His dynamic pieces drew on real life objects and often tried to find a balance between real and abstract, creating unique pieces in the process.</P>
