    <p><em>Nocturne</em>, a four ton steel sculpture, currently sits next to the Art-Sociology building at the University of Maryland. Before being shown at UMD, the work was a part of the Artscape Sculpture Exhibiton in Baltimore.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Dunnill travelled in India in 2001 to gain experience with steel in ship breaking yards. Eventually, amongst other works, this experience led to the creation of <em>Nocturne</em>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The work is an example of how Dunnill's work is inspired by the industrial side of America. There are a number of different possible interpretations for <em>Nocturne</em>. The steel Dunnill uses tells a story in itself in the way that it was intricately bent.</p> 
    <br>
    <p>Throughout his work, the meaning of his pieces stayed largely on how "materials spoke to him". Trevor Richardson and Scott Habes wrote in <em>Andrew Dunnill: Extractions</em> that the piece has been interpreted as a representation of the body and revealing emotion over the aesthetics of such a piece.</p>
