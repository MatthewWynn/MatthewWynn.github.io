   <p> This November, Maryland voters will decide whether to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. The referendum — Question 4 — comes as marijuana use among young adults across the U.S. reached its highest rates since 1988 last year, according to the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/marijuana-hallucinogen-use-among-young-adults-reached-all-time-high-2021">National Institutes of Health.</a> </p>
   <p>Poll numbers show majority support for legalization across all major political party affiliations. 65 percent of Democrats, 65 percent of independents and 54 percent of Republicans are in support, according to a <a href="https://www.goucher.edu/hughes-center/documents/Goucher-College-Poll-March-2022-Part-1.pdf">Goucher College poll.</a></p>
   <p>Among registered voters, support for marijuana legalization falls just below 3 in 4, signaling the legislation is sure to pass.</p>

   <p>But, what then?</p>
   <p>If passed, a new <a href="https://elections.maryland.gov/elections/2022/Letter%20to%20Administrator%20of%20Elections%20Lamone%20w%20Summaries%202022%20(1).pdf">amendment</a> would legalize the possession, use and private growing of marijuana for people over 21 beginning July 1, 2023. It would also require the General Assembly to begin work on legislation regarding the regulation, distribution and taxation of cannabis in the state. During this period, the sale of marijuana will remain illegal.</p>
   <p>The law would additionally create a <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2022RS/amds/bil_0007/HB0837_16382301.pdf">community reinvestment and repair fund</a> to dedicate at least 30 percent of revenues from adult-use cannabis to communities deemed most impacted by the disproportionate enforcement of cannabis prohibition.</p>
   <p>To understand how this process will play out, we must look to other states.</p>

   <p>In Maryland, delegates are looking to the 19 states that have legalized recreational marijuana use for guidelines on how to implement a cannabis system that prioritizes revenue, equity and access.</p>
   <p>The House Cannabis Referendum and Legalization Workgroup, the General Assembly committee in charge of drafting regulations should the referendum pass in November, discussed preliminary plans for licensing and taxation during its meeting in June.</p>
   <p>House Bill 837, which would go into full effect if the referendum passes, outlines provisions for possession amounts. It would also immediately expunge charges for simple possession across the state and allow those currently incarcerated for simple possession to be resentenced.</p>
   <p>In addition to these provisions, the committee will also conduct studies about the public health impacts of legalized marijuana, such as drug addiction, advertising and youth drug use.</p>
   <p>The committee aims to complete drafting commercial regulations by 2023, said committee Chair Luke Clippinger. If this is the case, recreational dispensaries may open as soon as 2024, in accordance with the timelines of states like Colorado and California.</p>

   <p>Dr. John Hudak, deputy director at the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution, touted states like Colorado as models for marijuana legalization. Colorado has done a great job in terms of establishing seed-to-sale tracking and reasonable tax rates that balance demand and curve the illicit cannabis market, Hudak said. The latter goal often includes ensuring prices will match those often found in illicit sales and strategically placing dispensaries at easy-to-access locations based on population density.</p>
   <p>What Colorado’s model lacked was a system that fostered and maintained equity, Hudak said. States like Illinois and Massachusetts have seen more success in that realm, allowing for a more effective criminal justice system and widening opportunities for smaller, minority-owned cannabis businesses.</p>
   <p>States like New York, Virginia and Connecticut have established much more robust guidelines for equity, though these innovative provisions are too new to gauge, Hudak said.</p>
   <p>“I can't say those three will be successful, but if they are, I think they’re gonna be models of equity programs in the United States moving forward," Hudak said.</p>
